### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**albertml/albertml** âœ¨ _Welcome to my GitHub profile_ âœ¨

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as remote iOS Developer
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SwiftUI and Combine
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on project with swift Language
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about swift and iOS development...
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at twitter @AlbertoGaudicos and facebook @iksas.nedyaj...
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am a simple person. When I'm not at work, sometimes I do coding for sample projects and uploaded here we're I can apply my learnings by coding it but mostly I dedicate my time together with my own family. I love cycling, watching movies, playing basketball and playing mobile and computer games...
